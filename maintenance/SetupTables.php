 * SetupTables.php
 * Installer for the WikiDB table structure.
 *
 * This file installs the tables required for the WikiDB extension, and will
 * also update any existing installations if the table structure has changed
 * between versions.  It does not populate the tables at all, as this can be very
 * time-consuming and may not be required in all instances.  See the other scripts
 * in this directory (ending .php) for the various different methods for
 * populating/updating the actual data.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *		None.

// TODO: Check the following items:
// 		 * The 'title' fields were changed from 'varchar(255)' to
//		   'varchar(255) BINARY'.  However, this doesn't seem to make any difference
//		   to the mysqldump output for these tables, so I am assuming the change
//		   doesn't require any fixing here.  I need to check if this is
//		   actually the case or whether it is something we need to detect and
//		   repair as part of this script.
//		 * It is possible that old installations of WikiDB had their tables created
//		   using the wrong storage engine.  In the days before this install script,
//		   the table definitions were on the wiki, and these specified that the
//		   MyISAM table type should be used.  In addition, older versions of
//		   MediaWiki didn't implement the $wgDBTableOptions variable, and in this
//		   situation any new tables would use whatever the default storage engine is
//		   set to in the DB configuration, so even with these scripts the wrong
//		   engine may have been used.
//		   Any new installations will use the correct table type, but we currently
//		   don't attempt to fix any existing tables that may have been created
//		   with the wrong type.  To my knowledge, the storage type doesn't actually
//		   matter to the extension, except certain engines may be more stable or
//		   offer speed/storage space advantages.  We therefore don't make any checks
//		   for this, but if it is found to be relevant then we should add the
//		   appropriate checks and fixes to this script.
//		 * I renamed the indexes which were based on namespace/title pairs from
//		   "name_title" to "ns_title", as this is somewhat clearer, however existing
//		   DBs aren't being updated to use these new names.  I don't
//		   think this makes a difference, as index names don't really seem to have
//	 	   any relevance, so I have no plans to add the necessary code to perform
//		   this update.  If a valid reason to update existing schemas arises, then I
//		   will add the necessary code at that point.

// Note that we use the literal table names in this file, rather than our
// pWIKIDB_tbl* constants.  The constants are used in the main extension code so
// that renames may be performed without massive code changes, however in our
// maintenance scripts we need to be clear about exactly which table we are
// referring to, so we use the literal table names instead.
